# How to use

As Yoga is built with conventions in mind, there are a couple of requirements needed with your folder structure for it to work.

## Conventions

Here's the exhaustive list of files that are supported by Yoga:

```bash
.
├── src
│   ├── graphql
│   │   └── Query.ts
│   ├── context.ts  (optional)
│   ├── express.ts  (optional)
│   └── server.ts   (optional)
└── yoga.config.ts  (optional)
```

- `src/graphql/*` (required): The folder in which you define all your resolvers
- `src/context.ts` (optional): A file to define the context of your GraphQL server.
- `src/express.ts` (optional): A file to access the underlying express instance (and use middlewares, expose webhooks etc..)
- `src/yoga.config.ts` (optional): [See configuration here](../configuration)
- `src/server.ts` (optional): Where you define your own GraphQL server if needed. (**Adding this file ejects you from the conventions**)

### Examples

**`graphql/*` (required)**

The folder in which you define all your resolvers

```ts
// src/graphql/Query.ts
import { objectType } from "yoga";

export const Query = objectType({
  name: "Query",
  definition(t) {
    t.string("hello", o => "world");
  }
});
```

**`context.ts` (optional)**

A file to define the context of your GraphQL server. It must default export a function.

```ts
// src/context.ts
import { context } from "yoga";
import { orm } from "./my-orm";

// `context` is an optional helper to provide type-safety and autocompletion
export default context(({ req }) => ({ req, orm }));
```

**`express.ts` (optional)**

A file to access the underlying express instance (and use middlewares, expose webhooks etc..)

```ts
// src/express.ts
import { express } from "yoga";
import { middleware } from "my-express-middleware";

// `express` is an optional helper to provide type-safety and autocompletion
export default express(app => {
  // Define any express related logic using the injected `app` express instance
  app.use(middleware);
  // app.get('/login', ...)
  // app.get('/logout', ...)
});
```

## Eject from conventions

Although Yoga is built on top of many conventions, you can very simply opt-out from it if needed at some point in your development

> Note: **This step is not irreversible. Don't be afraid of trying it.**
