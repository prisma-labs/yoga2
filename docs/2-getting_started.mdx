# Getting started

## From scratch

Bootstrap a ready-to-use GraphQL server based on handcrafted boilerplates that helps you get setup in a few seconds.

- Run the Yoga bootsrapper tool

```bash
yarn create yoga
```

or

```bash
npm init yoga
```

- Select `Start from scratch`

```
? Start from scratch or from an existing database? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ Start from scratch
  Start from an existing database
```

- Select the template you're looking for

```bash
? Choose a GraphQL server template? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ minimal-yoga (Basic starter template)
  db-yoga (Template with Prisma database support)
```

- Follow the CLI intructions
- Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
- You're ready to start üöÄ

## From an existing database

Take advantage of Prisma's introspection capabilities to bootstrap a ready-to-use GraphQL Server on top of your existing database.

> Note: The current workflow is temporary until we open up the Prisma CLI's API.

- Create an empty folder

```bash
mkdir new-project && cd new-project
```

- Run `prisma init` (or `npx prisma init` if you don't have the prisma cli installed globally)

```bash
prisma init
```

- Select `Use existing database`

```bash
? Set up a new Prisma server or deploy to an existing server? (Use arrow keys)

  Set up a new Prisma server for local development (based on docker-compose):
‚ùØ Use existing database      Connect to existing database
  Create new database        Set up a local database using Docker

  Or deploy to an existing Prisma server:
  Demo server                Hosted demo environment incl. database
  Use other server           Manually provide endpoint of a running Prisma server
```

- Select the kind of database you want to introspect

```bash
? What kind of database do you want to deploy to? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ MySQL             MySQL compliant databases like MySQL or MariaDB
  PostgreSQL        PostgreSQL database
  MongoDB           Mongo Database
```

- Follow the rest of the CLI workflow. For PostgreSQL, here's what you might expect

```bash
? Does your database contain existing data? Yes
? Enter database host localhost
? Enter database port 5432
? Enter database user prisma
? Enter database password prisma
? Enter database name (the database includes the schema) prisma
? Use SSL? No
? Please select the schema you want to introspect default$default
Introspecting database default$default 703ms
Created datamodel definition based on 11 tables.
? Select the programming language for the generated Prisma client Don't generate

Created 3 new files:

  prisma.yml           Prisma service definition
  datamodel.prisma    GraphQL SDL-based datamodel (foundation for database)
  docker-compose.yml   Docker configuration file
``
```

- Once you're done, run the Yoga bootsrapper tool

```bash
yarn create yoga
```

or

```bash
npm init yoga
```

- Select `Start from an existing database`

```bash
? Start from scratch or from an existing database?
  Start from scratch
‚ùØ Start from an existing database
```

- Select the `Query` and `Mutation` fields you want to expose (press `a` to select all)

```bash
? Select the types and fields you would like to expose (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <
i> to invert selection)
 Query
‚ùØ‚óØ user
 ‚óØ users
 ‚óØ usersConnection
 ‚óØ post
 ‚óØ posts
 ‚óØ postsConnection
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)
```

- Run `yarn prisma deploy`
- Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
- You're ready to start üöÄ
